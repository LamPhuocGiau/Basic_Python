## Random variables

Random variable is possible values of random events. It is saved on capital letter (X,Y,...)to be sepecified algebra and probility. A Random Variable's set of values is the Sample Space.

<details>
<summary>Example tossing a coin:</summary>

we could get Heads or Tails.Let's give them the values Heads=0 and Tails=1 and we have a Random Variable "X":

X = random variable.

possible value = 0 or 1.

random event = Head or Tails.

X = {0, 1} = sample space

**Probability**.

P(X = value) = probability of that value.

<summary>Example two dice are tossed</summary>

The Random Variable is X = "The sum of the scores on the two dice".

1st Die : 1	2	3	4	5	6.

2nd Die	1	2	3	4	5	6	7.

Let's make a table of all possible values:

2	3	4	5	6	7	8
3	4	5	6	7	8	9
4	5	6	7	8	9	10
5	6	7	8	9	10	11
6	7	8	9	10	11	12

There are 6 × 6 = 36 possible outcomes, and the Sample Space (which is the sum of the scores on the two dice) is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}.

Let's count how often each value occurs, and work out the probabilities:

2 occurs just once, so P(X = 2) = 1/36.

3 occurs twice, so P(X = 3) = 2/36 = 1/18.

4 occurs three times, so P(X = 4) = 3/36 = 1/12.

5 occurs four times, so P(X = 5) = 4/36 = 1/9.

6 occurs five times, so P(X = 6) = 5/36.

7 occurs six times, so P(X = 7) = 6/36 = 1/6.

8 occurs five times, so P(X = 8) = 5/36.

9 occurs four times, so P(X = 9) = 4/36 = 1/9.

10 occurs three times, so P(X = 10) = 3/36 = 1/12.

11 occurs twice, so P(X = 11) = 2/36 = 1/18.

12 occurs just once, so P(X = 12) = 1/36.

**A Range of Values**.
<details>
<summary>Example: What is the probability that the sum of the scores is 5, 6, 7 or 8?</summary>
In other words: What is P(5 ≤ X ≤ 8)?

P(5 ≤ X ≤ 8) =P(X=5) + P(X=6) + P(X=7) + P(X=8)
            =(4+5+6+5)/36
            =20/36
            =5/9
