## Querying single table
Country table:                          
id | name | population | area           
--- | --- | --- | ---                   
1 | France | 66600000 | 640680          
2 | Germany | 80700000 | 357000         
... | ... |  ... | ...                  

City table:
Id | name | country_id | population | rating 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Paris | 1 | 2243000 | 5 
2 | Berlin | 2 | 3460000 | 3 
...| ... | ... | ... | ...

Fetch all columns from the country table:
```
    SELECT *
    FROM country;
```
Fetch id and name columns from the city table:
```
    SELECT id, name
    FROM city;
```
Fetch city names sorted by the rating column in the DESCending order:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    ORDER BY rating DESC;
```    
Fetch city names sorted by the rating column in the default ASCending order:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    ORDER BY rating [ASC];
```

## Filtering the output
**Comparison operators**.

Fetch names of cities that have a rating above 3:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE rating > 3;
```
Fetch names of cities that are neither Berlin nor Madrid:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE name != 'Berlin'
     AND name != 'Madrid';
```
**Text operators**.

Fetch names of cities that start with a 'P' or end with an 's':
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE name LIKE 'P%'
     OR name LIKE '%s';
```
Fetch names of cities that start with any letter followed by 'ublin' (like Dublin in Ireland or Lublin in Poland):
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE name LIKE '_ublin';
```
**Other operators**.

Fetch names of cities that have a population between 500K and 5M:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE population BETWEEN 500000 AND 5000000;
```
Fetch names of cities that don't miss a rating value:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE rating IS NOT NULL;
```
Fetch names of cities that are in countries with IDs 1, 4, 7, or 8:
```
    SELECT name
    FROM city
    WHERE country_id IN (1, 4, 7, 8);
```

## Querying multible tables
**Inner join**.

JOIN (or explicitly INNER JOIN) returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
```
        SELECT city.name, country.name
        FROM city
        [INNER] JOIN country
         ON city.country_id = country.id;
```

**Left join**.

LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table with corresponding rows from the right table. If there's no matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the second table
```
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
LEFT JOIN country
 ON city.country_id = country.id;
```
![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/left_join.png)

**Right join**.

RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table with corresponding rows from the left table. If there's no matching row, NULLs are returned as values from the left table
```
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
RIGHT JOIN country
 ON city.country_id = country.id;
```
![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/right_join.png)

**Full join**.

FULL JOIN (or explicitly FULL OUTER JOIN) returns all rows from both tables â€“ if there's no matching row in the second table, NULLs are returned.
```
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
FULL [OUTER] JOIN country
 ON city.country_id = country.id;
```
![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/full_join.png)

**Cross join**.

CROSS JOIN returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables. There are two syntaxes available.
```
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
CROSS JOIN country;
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city, country;
```
![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/cross_join.png)

**Natural join**.

NATURAL JOIN will join tables by all columns with the same name.
```
SELECT city.name, country.name
FROM city
NATURAL JOIN country;
```
![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/natural_join.png)

NATURAL JOIN used these columns to match rows: city.id, city.name, country.id, country.name NATURAL JOIN is very rarely used in practice.

**Column and table aliases**.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/column_and_table_aliases.png)

**Self join**.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/self_join.png)

**Non equi self join**.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/Non_equi_self_join.png)

**Multiple join**.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/multiple_joins.png)

**Join with multiple conditions**.

You can use multiple JOIN conditions using the ON keyword once and the AND keywords as many times as you need.

## Aggregation and grouping
GROUP BY groups together rows that have the same values in specified columns. It computes summaries (aggregates) for each unique combination of values. 

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/aggregating_and_grouping.png)

**Aggregation functions**
    - avg(expr): average value for rows within the group
    - count(expr): count of values for rows within the group
    - max(expr): maximum value within the group
    - min(expr): minimum value within the group
    - sum(expr): sum of values within the group
**Example queries**
Find out the number of cities:
```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM city;
```
Find out the number of cities with non-null ratings:
```
SELECT COUNT(rating)
FROM city;
```
Find out the number of distinctive country values:
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_id)
FROM city;
```
Find out the smallest and the greatest country populations:
```
SELECT MIN(population), MAX(population)
FROM country;
```
Find out the total population of cities in respective countries:
```
SELECT country_id, SUM(population)
FROM city
GROUP BY country_id;
```
Find out the average rating for cities in respective countries if the average is above 3.0:
```
SELECT country_id, AVG(rating)
FROM city
GROUP BY country_id
HAVING AVG(rating) > 3.0;
```

## Subqueries
A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query, or inside another subquery. There are different types of subqueries. 

**Single value**.

The simplest subquery returns exactly one column and exactly one row. It can be used with comparison operators =, <, <=, >, or >=.

This query finds cities with the same rating as Paris:
```
SELECT name FROM city
WHERE rating = (
 SELECT rating
 FROM city
 WHERE name = 'Paris'
);
```
**Multiple values**.

A subquery can also return multiple columns or multiple rows. Such subqueries can be used with operators **IN, EXISTS, ALL, or ANY**.

This query finds cities in countries that have a population above 20M:
```
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE country_id IN (
 SELECT country_id
 FROM country
 WHERE population > 20000000
);
```
**Correlated**.

A correlated subquery refers to the tables introduced in the outer query. A correlated
subquery depends on the outer query. It cannot be run independently from the outer
query.

This query finds cities with a population greater than the average population in the
country:
```
SELECT *
FROM city main_city
WHERE population > (
 SELECT AVG(population)
 FROM city average_city
 WHERE average_city.country_id = main_city.country_id
);
```
This query finds countries that have at least one city:
```
SELECT name
FROM country
WHERE EXISTS (
 SELECT *
 FROM city
 WHERE country_id = country.id
);
```

## Set operations
Set operations are used to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result. The combined queries must return the same number of columns and compatible data types. The names of the corresponding columns can be different.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/set_operations.png)

**Union**

UNION combines the results of two result sets and removes duplicates.

UNION ALL doesn't remove duplicate rows.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/union.png)

This query displays German cyclists together with German skaters:
```
SELECT name
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'DE'
UNION / UNION ALL
SELECT name
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'DE';
```
**Intersect**
INTERSECT returns only rows that appear in both result sets.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/intersect.png)

This query displays German cyclists who are also German skaters at the same time:
```
SELECT name
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'DE'
INTERSECT
SELECT name
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'DE';
```
**Except**
EXCEPT returns only the rows that appear in the first result set but do not appear in the second result set.

![alt text](https://github.com/LamPhuocGiau/Data_Engineer/blob/main/Theories/Images/except.png)

This query displays German cyclists unless they are also German skaters at the same time:
```
SELECT name
FROM cycling
WHERE country = 'DE'
EXCEPT / MINUS
SELECT name
FROM skating
WHERE country = 'DE'
```
